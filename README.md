# 🎯 Bubble Shooter Game

Welcome to the **Bubble Shooter Game**, a classic arcade-style
game developed as part of our Term Project for the CSE 102 course. 
The game is built using the **Modern iGraphics** library in C, offering an 
engaging experience with colorful bubbles, strategic shooting mechanics,
and a fun interface.
The goal of the game is to clear all the bubbles by shooting them strategically.
Additional features like level-based progression, game-over logic, and a polished 
UI have been added to enhance the overall experience.
